==================

This is the source code an data for my [personal website](http://www.minjiezha.com). It is powered by [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll).

## Design

The design is inspired by [Zach Holman's blog](http://zachholman.com/) and the [Thinking with Type](http://www.thinkingwithtype.com/) website. Some images are copied from there.

## Commenting

Commenting is not supported. I was trying to do so using [Disqus](http://disqus.com/), but the style provided by Disqus is not quite fit with my site. So I gave it up at last.
